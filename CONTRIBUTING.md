Thanks for wanting to contribute to pipemesh.

If you need any access, create an Issue or contact me and we'll discuss from there.

If developing, please use a seaparate branch to master, and when you're ready, open a pull request. Please only do this if you're confident you won't need another pull request after making a small update. Write unit tests if you can, and documentation in Google style. If you've created a new module, make sure it is well represented in the documentation created by readthedocs.

Thanks,

Duncan
